# TankGame

A 2D game made in Python using Pygame. The goal behind the game is to give someone the ability to code their own AI for the enemy tank.

One possibility beyond simply making the AI dodge and shoot is to create a boss battle. Simply create a sub class of Tank which has all the modifications required for your boss (e.g. more health, slower speed). Then, make it so that tank2 is of that type instead of Tank. Now all that's left is programming the actual behavior in your AI class.
